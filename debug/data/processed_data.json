[{"text": "I'm warning for a wall of text here. \n Actually there's quite a good explanation for this phenomenon. This is what we in marketing call branding. That is the creation of a brand. A brand in turn is \"A person, name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies one seller's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers.\" This is according to the american marketing association. Now in this case it has to do with personal branding. \n Rein, Kotler and Stoller (1987) define a celebrity as as \u201dA person whose name has attention-getting, interest-riveting, profit generating value\u201d. By using a celebrity for endorsement in campaigns you can achieve something called co-branding. That means that the name of a celebrity is used to endorse a particular politician or party. This is the same as what Nike for example does with Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods for example. They use their names, big names in their particular fields, to endorse endorse different kinds of products to give them more exposure. \n Say that you want to sell a shoe. If you see two ads, one with just the shoe and one with Michael Jordan (or whatever celebrity you know of) you are by more or less always going to pay more attention to the one with the celebrity. \n Alright so now we've covered the basics. Now we are coming to word of mouth or as we are here online we are talking about word of mouse. Because of the nature of politics, by that I mean that it's an area which very few people actually know that much about and the information can be ambiguous, they look to so called opinion leaders. These opinion leaders can be more or less anyone. For example Steven Colbert, Bill O'Riley,Engadget, Ray W Johnson or what ever ... someone people look to for some kind of information they are too lazy to find out themselves and which give them the information they think they need. \n Now say that you know jack shit about politics and you are ha huge fan of Madonna, then you'll most probably think that Madonna probably is on to something. So instead of finding stuff out yourself you vote like Madonna, because you \"know\" Madonna and you like her, so she's probably right. That means that Madonna is your opinion leader in this case. Same goes for basically all other brands, both for intangible and tangible \"products\". \n I could probably continue writing about this stuff all day but I think you get the picture from this.", "tokens": [40, 1101, 6509, 329, 257, 3355, 286, 2420, 994, 13, 220, 198, 18689, 612, 338, 2407, 257, 922, 7468, 329, 428, 10733, 13, 770, 318, 644, 356, 287, 7124, 869, 24150, 13, 1320, 318, 262, 6282, 286, 257, 4508, 13, 317, 4508, 287, 1210, 318, 366, 32, 1048, 11, 1438, 11, 3381, 11, 1486, 11, 6194, 11, 393, 597, 584, 3895, 326, 21079, 530, 18583, 338, 922, 393, 2139, 355, 7310, 422, 883, 286, 584, 23531, 526, 770, 318, 1864, 284, 262, 45630, 272, 7124, 8112, 13, 2735, 287, 428, 1339, 340, 468, 284, 466, 351, 2614, 24150, 13, 220, 198, 22299, 11, 21702, 1754, 290, 520, 49252, 357, 27301, 8, 8160, 257, 16527, 355, 355, 564, 251, 32, 1048, 3025, 1438, 468, 3241, 12, 37210, 11, 1393, 12, 11590, 889, 11, 7630, 15453, 1988, 447, 251, 13, 2750, 1262, 257, 16527, 329, 17819, 287, 9964, 345, 460, 4620, 1223, 1444, 763, 12, 17938, 278, 13, 1320, 1724, 326, 262, 1438, 286, 257, 16527, 318, 973, 284, 11438, 257, 1948, 14971, 393, 2151, 13, 770, 318, 262, 976, 355, 644, 23817, 329, 1672, 857, 351, 3899, 8078, 290, 17030, 16483, 329, 1672, 13, 1119, 779, 511, 3891, 11, 1263, 3891, 287, 511, 1948, 7032, 11, 284, 11438, 11438, 1180, 6982, 286, 3186, 284, 1577, 606, 517, 7111, 13, 220, 198, 13816, 326, 345, 765, 284, 3677, 257, 17292, 13, 1002, 345, 766, 734, 9011, 11, 530, 351, 655, 262, 17292, 290, 530, 351, 3899, 8078, 357, 273, 4232, 16527, 345, 760, 286, 8, 345, 389, 416, 517, 393, 1342, 1464, 1016, 284, 1414, 517, 3241, 284, 262, 530, 351, 262, 16527, 13, 220, 198, 40967, 523, 783, 356, 1053, 5017, 262, 19165, 13, 2735, 356, 389, 2406, 284, 1573, 286, 5422, 393, 355, 356, 389, 994, 2691, 356, 389, 3375, 546, 1573, 286, 10211, 13, 4362, 286, 262, 3450, 286, 4819, 11, 416, 326, 314, 1612, 326, 340, 338, 281, 1989, 543, 845, 1178, 661, 1682, 760, 326, 881, 546, 290, 262, 1321, 460, 307, 27102, 11, 484, 804, 284, 523, 1444, 4459, 2766, 13, 2312, 4459, 2766, 460, 307, 517, 393, 1342, 2687, 13, 1114, 1672, 8239, 31368, 11, 3941, 440, 6, 49, 9618, 11, 7936, 324, 1136, 11, 7760, 370, 5030, 393, 644, 1683, 2644, 2130, 661, 804, 284, 329, 617, 1611, 286, 1321, 484, 389, 1165, 16931, 284, 1064, 503, 2405, 290, 543, 1577, 606, 262, 1321, 484, 892, 484, 761, 13, 220, 198, 2735, 910, 326, 345, 760, 14509, 7510, 546, 4819, 290, 345, 389, 387, 3236, 4336, 286, 42345, 11, 788, 345, 1183, 749, 2192, 892, 326, 42345, 2192, 318, 319, 284, 1223, 13, 1406, 2427, 286, 4917, 3404, 503, 3511, 345, 3015, 588, 42345, 11, 780, 345, 366, 16275, 1, 42345, 290, 345, 588, 607, 11, 523, 673, 338, 2192, 826, 13, 1320, 1724, 326, 42345, 318, 534, 4459, 3554, 287, 428, 1339, 13, 16766, 2925, 329, 6209, 477, 584, 11394, 11, 1111, 329, 47734, 290, 24607, 366, 29498, 1911, 220, 198, 314, 714, 2192, 2555, 3597, 546, 428, 3404, 477, 1110, 475, 314, 892, 345], "length": 512}, {"text": "If this Plan B is the same as the \"morning after pill\" I was prescribed 10 years ago (it wasn't OTC then, and going to get it from a furious hospital doctor [because doctor's offices were closed on a Saturday] who almost kicked me out because I didn't have a regular gyno, which meant she had to do a bunch of other checks on me as well was rather traumatic to me - for almost a year I turned sheet white at the notion of having to see a gyno), I'd have to agree.

Luckily we were at a rest stop and a couple truckers had extinguishers. But it was too late much of the truck had been burned. Come to find out a fuel line had broken. Well it was the only truck we had at the time that could pull and money was tight so we replaced the interior and got her running right and continued to use it. About a year later my father and I were changing the oil and hear a clank in the drain pan. I looked through and to my amazement was piece of the piston skirt. So the truck got parked and the family got a new one. Several years later i decided i missed it and sanded it down and painted it white. Took the motor out and replaced it with a fresh one i built myself. Now its as happy as can be with no rust and a healthy 460.

To add to this, I'd like to point out that policing cheating via third party software is pretty much the ONLY thing that Blizzard (or any other online game developer) should police.  The only exceptions I think would involve harassment (as in spam or real life threats) and other instances in which another player's actions are completely unavoidable to his/her victim. \n When developers step in to enforce \"fair play\" on players who are completely staying within the confines of the software that the developers themselves put out, you end up with a lot of discrepancies and unjust bans.  It's happened countless times, and I'm sure most of you have heard of similar situations where somebody found a quick way to get ahead of other players via legitimate, in-game means, and got banned for it.  It's happened on Xbox live, in Guild Wars, and EA is pretty notorious for this as well. If Blizzard adopted similar policies, we'd see people banned for clearing inferno with force armor abuse (release patch), stacking attack speed pre-nerf, using the currently \"OP\" trail of cinders rune, or farming with a WW barb.  These are all instances that many people have considered to be unfair advantage exploits, but it's detrimental to the game as a whole to ban players for such innovation. \n Some of you are probably saying \"well those exploits didn't directly effect other players.\" Sure, it's definitely not nice to scam people, but there could be so many things that people would consider to be a scam.  If they banned people for trade window scamming, who's to say they shouldn't ban people for things like equipping weak gold find gear in team games, or doing the max bid \"exploit\" that everyone was talking about a few weeks ago.  Both of these come at other players' expense, but none of them violate the terms of service. They are unforeseen, specific situations that inevitably arise in any online game and would be impossible to write them all into the EULA.  If they were to suddenly ban people for rules that were never outlined, it becomes yet another PR nightmare for them, as well as a (I think) very unethical policy. \n If Blizzard doesn't want people performing certain actions within the legitimate confines of their software, then they need to take it out on themselves, not the players.  By this I mean FIX IT ON THE SOFTWARE END so that players are unable to do this in the first place.  Granted, trade window scams are usually avoidable user error, but I also think they could be made safer to use, like they were for the most part in WoW. (Maybe they are by now, I haven't actually used one in awhile).  Blizzard is usually pretty good about fixing stuff like this, and I think their philosophy is similar to mine in that scams and exploits should be made impossible (if at all possible) before account bans should even be considered. \n Lastly, in the case of a possible \"macro\" like OP's situation, whether or not using a macro that allows you to switch an item out of the trade window quickly is an offense worth banning someone for is somewhat debatable.  While it is a third party program, it's impact on the game is minimal and avoidable (as seen in the OP's video).  It's also difficult to prove because some people might just be able to swap items quickly through practice.  OP's video did seem impossibly fast to me, but how would Blizzard be able to fairly gauge how fast is too fast for trade window swapping?  Besides, it still kind of goes along with what I've been saying about how player actions shouldn't be banned.  Macros are designed to simulate an action that a player can do anyway, just faster.  This type of situation can be completely avoided in the future if Blizzard fixes the trade window to lock up for several seconds after any type of item swap is detected. \n If OP is reading this far, I think your case would have been better accepted had you argued his offense was the use of a third party macro program, not the scam attempt itself.

I hit some mobs, used my Diamond skin and clearly saw it reducing my cooldown in large chunks. Was the coefficient changed at all? I dunno, it's been so long since I used Spectral Blades, but on one of those large numbered groups in A3 it seemed to proc quite often. \n Act 3(MP0): Wow, they really nerfed it. This might be fun to try new specs with, as more that wouldn't be viable due to high dmg before could now be workable. Might not be the most efficient way to farm, but if you want to mix things up then why not? Enemies die very fast. \n Act 3(MP3-4): Getting harder. Seems about where Inferno is now. \n Act 3(MP5): Alright, their health is now pretty high. To high for me to want to farm with my current DPS. Damage done to me is noticeably higher, and I've died from some real nasty spike damage. If you have trouble keeping stuff frozen, and you run into a nasty affix combo, you're gonna have a bad time. \n Act 3 MP(10). Tried this with another wizard, and while we killed an easy affix pack, monster health is just to high to make me want to run it. Normal mobs can hit like a truck and if you lag on your windup, you're dead. \n I also tried some low MP Act 1, and while I enjoy being able to get top quality loot, the enemies are to spread out for it to be efficient farming.

There are two main lessons a player must learn, and a bunch of secondary ones that stem from that. \n Lesson 1: Play Well Individually \n This is mostly the obvious part. If you're playing a sniper, get headshots, deal with counter sniping, and so on. Each class has their own foibles and learning curve. Engineer is probably the best class for the 'rote' aspects of this, as much of their early game strategy basically comes down to building perfectly at an optimal speed, like getting the sentry and dispenser up by the main spawn to cover the courtyard and both forward entries ASAP on round start. Other classes are more implicit, like knowing how to use the maps for scouts, spies, and soldiers. Knowing how to set an effective sticky trap. \n You may not necessarily be great at a given class, but you migrate out of 'noob' territory in my book when it's clear your play mistakes are incidental rather than systemic. Got killed by a random enemy poking around a corner? Not a noob error. Missed a clutch shot and died in an important firefight? Happens to the best of us. Over-extend into a front line? Probably a noob mistake. \n Lesson 2: Play Your Team \n One thing I find really frustrating on many pub servers is that most people never really seem to get the idea of working together as a team. All classes have their strengths and weaknesses, and while you can go far on your own personal skill, the force multiplication of a coordinated effort is so huge that on pubs it is usually more important than skill unless it's entirely lopsided. \n Obvious things are like picking classes that cover where the team is weak. There's also more subtle stuff, like if you have an engineer building a forward base, help guard the zone for a few seconds if you don't have an immediate priority target to reach. Understanding the dynamics of timing and supporting the moves your allies make is a gigantic step out of noobdom. See an uber? Follow it. Know a spy's getting in position to sap? Try to pull attention. \n At a higher level of play, you can begin to perform some actions that would normally be somewhat noobish with deeper thought and skill in mind to achieve a bigger goal. For example, you're a scout and can afford to break ahead of your team's push of the fourth point, and the fifth is clear. But the other team is moving as a squad back to the other point. Do you cap or harass? This is a complex question, but there are times when the right answer is to run through their team to try and force a medic kill or at least slow their push enough to get the cap and give the rest of your team spare moments to reload for the fight.", "tokens": [3633, 314, 836, 470, 881, 1104, 262, 3381, 645, 672, 583, 384, 11, 314, 892, 262, 749, 4465, 6770, 286, 257, 2137, 318, 511, 2694, 284, 1833, 290, 670, 287, 262, 1074, 8925, 284, 4574, 329, 5373, 13, 1318, 389, 734, 1388, 11658, 257, 2137, 1276, 2193, 11, 290, 257, 7684, 286, 9233, 3392, 326, 10717, 422, 326, 13, 220, 198, 12892, 261, 352, 25, 3811, 3894, 1423, 16335, 220, 198, 770, 318, 4632, 262, 3489, 636, 13, 1002, 345, 821, 2712, 257, 26160, 11, 651, 1182, 20910, 11, 1730, 351, 3753, 3013, 34690, 11, 290, 523, 319, 13, 5501, 1398, 468, 511, 898, 11511, 18764, 290, 4673, 12133, 13, 23164, 318, 2192, 262, 1266, 1398, 329, 262, 705, 2519, 6, 7612, 286, 428, 11, 355, 881, 286, 511, 1903, 983, 4811, 6209, 2058, 866, 284, 2615, 7138, 379, 281, 16586, 2866, 11, 588, 1972, 262, 1908, 563, 290, 18905, 263, 510, 416, 262, 1388, 10922, 284, 3002, 262, 34941, 290, 1111, 2651, 12784, 46199, 319, 2835, 923, 13, 3819, 6097, 389, 517, 16992, 11, 588, 6970, 703, 284, 779, 262, 8739, 329, 29663, 11, 28801, 11, 290, 5795, 13, 29154, 703, 284, 900, 281, 4050, 23408, 12840, 13, 220, 198, 921, 743, 407, 6646, 307, 1049, 379, 257, 1813, 1398, 11, 475, 345, 32492, 503, 286, 705, 3919, 672, 6, 7674, 287, 616, 1492, 618, 340, 338, 1598, 534, 711, 10135, 389, 40521, 2138, 621, 21971, 13, 11853, 2923, 416, 257, 4738, 4472, 39048, 1088, 257, 5228, 30, 1892, 257, 645, 672, 4049, 13, 4544, 276, 257, 22756, 2823, 290, 3724, 287, 281, 1593, 2046, 15481, 30, 18321, 641, 284, 262, 1266, 286, 514, 13, 3827, 12, 2302, 437, 656, 257, 2166, 1627, 30, 18578, 257, 645, 672, 7457, 13, 220, 198, 12892, 261, 362, 25, 3811, 3406, 4816, 220, 198, 1881, 1517, 314, 1064, 1107, 16655, 319, 867, 2240, 9597, 318, 326, 749, 661, 1239, 1107, 1283, 284, 651, 262, 2126, 286, 1762, 1978, 355, 257, 1074, 13, 1439, 6097, 423, 511, 18929, 290, 20256, 11, 290, 981, 345, 460, 467, 1290, 319, 534, 898, 2614, 5032, 11, 262, 2700, 48473, 286, 257, 22080, 3626, 318, 523, 3236, 326, 319, 46972, 340, 318, 3221, 517, 1593, 621, 5032, 4556, 340, 338, 5000, 300, 2840, 1384, 13, 220, 198, 1835, 1442, 1243, 389, 588, 10868, 6097, 326, 3002, 810, 262, 1074, 318, 4939, 13, 1318, 338, 635, 517, 11800, 3404, 11, 588, 611, 345, 423, 281, 11949, 2615, 257, 2651, 2779, 11, 1037, 4860, 262, 6516, 329, 257, 1178, 4201, 611, 345, 836, 470, 423, 281, 7103, 8475, 2496, 284, 3151, 13, 28491, 262, 17262, 286, 10576, 290, 6493, 262, 6100, 534, 7681, 787, 318, 257, 24804, 2239, 503, 286, 645, 672, 3438, 13, 4091, 281, 48110, 30, 7281, 340, 13, 9365, 257, 13997, 338, 1972, 287, 2292, 284, 31841, 30, 9993, 284, 2834, 3241, 13, 220, 198, 1629, 257, 2440, 1241, 286, 711, 11, 345, 460, 2221, 284, 1620, 617, 4028, 326, 561, 7685, 307, 6454, 645, 672, 680, 351, 9211, 1807, 290, 5032, 287, 2000, 284, 4620, 257, 5749], "length": 512}, {"text": "During the Abbey Road recording sessions, a number of basses were used.

Are you talking SIMT or SIMD? I have considerable experience with coding  real  world applications (in customer's hands) for many-core (single die) architectures at this scale and [much] larger. I also write compilers for them. Could you give us an estimate of your current fetch/ALU ratio? \n For those who don't know about these devices, let me put it into GPU terms (SIMT only; SIMD is much, much harder to analyze): fetch would correspond to a texture sample, ALU is the work done on the sample. If the arch's fetch/ALU ratio is 1:4, then you need 4 (pure, non loading) arithmetic operations per memory request to keep the part \"fed\". A ratio as low as 1:4 is only really possible with low clock rate/memory rate ratio, and (nearly pure) SIMT. For instance, a large RT pixel shader on a Radeon 5870 would have numbers like this. \n SIMT means \"single instruction multiple thread\" and refers to totally non-communicating processes. SIMD means \"single instruction multiple data\", where each lane is allowed to communicate. For instance, the SSE instruction HADD is SIMD, not SIMT, because the lanes of the vector unit \"talk\". Likewise, gather is SIMT, whereas permute is SIMD. \n For many core (single die) devices, another problem is that the workload has to be fairly homogenous across all the ALU [vector] units, or you will starve the units when they thrash the local working set of hot data. This means that for SIMT architectures, it is not just enough to have homogeneous per ALU [vector] work, but also homogeneous workload across the entire device. \n This is entirely different from, say, the large scale server x86 boxes. These devices are truly high-throughput serial devices, designed to allow an enormous amount of thrash on the local working set. They do this with high frequency rates, OOO pipes, and staged caches of every (ginormous) sizes, and narrow vector units.", "tokens": [2061, 5479, 30, 4231, 345, 3375, 23749, 51, 393, 23749, 35, 30, 314, 423, 11091, 1998, 351, 19617, 220, 1103, 220, 995, 5479, 357, 259, 6491, 338, 2832, 8, 329, 867, 12, 7295, 357, 29762, 4656, 8, 45619, 379, 428, 5046, 290, 685, 29482, 60, 4025, 13, 314, 635, 3551, 552, 34393, 329, 606, 13, 10347, 345, 1577, 514, 281, 8636, 286, 534, 1459, 21207, 14, 1847, 52, 8064, 30, 220, 198, 1114, 883, 508, 836, 470, 760, 546, 777, 4410, 11, 1309, 502, 1234, 340, 656, 11362, 2846, 357, 48913, 51, 691, 26, 23749, 35, 318, 881, 11, 881, 7069, 284, 16602, 2599, 21207, 561, 6053, 284, 257, 11743, 6291, 11, 8355, 52, 318, 262, 670, 1760, 319, 262, 6291, 13, 1002, 262, 3934, 338, 21207, 14, 1847, 52, 8064, 318, 352, 25, 19, 11, 788, 345, 761, 604, 357, 37424, 11, 1729, 11046, 8, 34768, 4560, 583, 4088, 2581, 284, 1394, 262, 636, 366, 19082, 1911, 317, 8064, 355, 1877, 355, 352, 25, 19, 318, 691, 1107, 1744, 351, 1877, 8801, 2494, 14, 31673, 2494, 8064, 11, 290, 357, 77, 11458, 5899, 8, 23749, 51, 13, 1114, 4554, 11, 257, 1588, 11923, 17465, 33030, 319, 257, 13082, 7618, 2154, 561, 423, 3146, 588, 428, 13, 220, 198, 23749, 51, 1724, 366, 29762, 12064, 3294, 4704, 1, 290, 10229, 284, 6635, 1729, 12, 10709, 12364, 7767, 13, 23749, 35, 1724, 366, 29762, 12064, 3294, 1366, 1600, 810, 1123, 11193, 318, 3142, 284, 10996, 13, 1114, 4554, 11, 262, 311, 5188, 12064, 367, 29266, 318, 23749, 35, 11, 407, 23749, 51, 11, 780, 262, 15296, 286, 262, 15879, 4326, 366, 16620, 1911, 22660, 11, 6431, 318, 23749, 51, 11, 9472, 9943, 1133, 318, 23749, 35, 13, 220, 198, 1114, 867, 4755, 357, 29762, 4656, 8, 4410, 11, 1194, 1917, 318, 326, 262, 26211, 468, 284, 307, 6547, 3488, 27897, 1973, 477, 262, 8355, 52, 685, 31364, 60, 4991, 11, 393, 345, 481, 47141, 262, 4991, 618, 484, 5636, 1077, 262, 1957, 1762, 900, 286, 3024, 1366, 13, 770, 1724, 326, 329, 23749, 51, 45619, 11, 340, 318, 407, 655, 1576, 284, 423, 3488, 32269, 583, 8355, 52, 685, 31364, 60, 670, 11, 475, 635, 3488, 32269, 26211, 1973, 262, 2104, 3335, 13, 220, 198, 770, 318, 5000, 1180, 422, 11, 910, 11, 262, 1588, 5046, 4382, 2124, 4521, 10559, 13, 2312, 4410, 389, 4988, 1029, 12, 9579, 1996, 11389, 4410, 11, 3562, 284, 1249, 281, 9812, 2033, 286, 5636, 1077, 319, 262, 1957, 1762, 900, 13, 1119, 466, 428, 351, 1029, 8373, 3965, 11, 440, 6684, 19860, 11, 290, 23393, 50177, 286, 790, 357, 1655, 579, 516, 8, 10620, 11, 290, 7135, 15879, 4991, 13], "length": 445}, {"text": "Clearly I'm open to both sexes as attractive when they meet my personal criteria for the phyiscal, emotional, mental, and sexually attractive requirements.", "tokens": [30638, 314, 1101, 1280, 284, 1111, 32487, 355, 10966, 618, 484, 1826, 616, 2614, 9987, 329, 262, 872, 88, 7860, 11, 7016, 11, 5110, 11, 290, 11363, 10966, 5359, 13], "length": 30}, {"text": "Maybe this is just a silly idea of mine, but what if actual warp time is increased?

Immediately, I was filled with a sense of dread and discomfort, and my surveillance of my surroundings did little to comfort me.  I was naked, laying on a large operating table made entirely of cold stainless steel.  The room I found myself in was completely empty, save for my metal platform, with the wall that my feet were towards being made of glass.  On the other side of the glass was my mother, talking nervously with some doctors and looking more and more hysterical as they attempted to comfort her.  My voice caught in my throat as I tried to call out, and my legs refused to budge as if welded to the steel.  At this moment, I noticed the single most excruciating pain I've felt in my life, and collapsed back onto the table.  I looked down at my chest, and saw a gaping, gory, bleeding chasm stretching from my collar bone down to my belly button.  I could feel my stomach turn, for as I looked closer, the inside of my chest was hollowed, as if I'd been cleaned like some game.  With uneasy trepidation, I plunged my right hand down, further and further into my chest, looking desperately for any organs that would remain.  For how could I live without them?  My hand returned, sheathed in a thick coating of blood, at which point I lost the ability to breathe.

I think both of you would be better off with more compatible people. \n I use drugs a lot like you do.  I'm not opposed to a bump of coke or two a couple times a year when it's around, I'll eat some mushrooms on a camping trip in the woods every couple years or so for a good cerebral dump and wipe, I smoke marijuana fairly regularly it's a good way to unwind with a beer at the end of the day, I drink beer and have begun brewing my own because it's a fun hobby, and I enjoy smoking cigars with my dad or my uncles when we have time to visit.  My girlfriend and I live together and I've never pushed anything on her.  She is aware of how I take my pleasure by the dose sometimes.  She enjoys beer, and has taken an interest in brewing so we have a shared hobby, and the occasional toke, but has no interest in other drugs.  I don't need her to take drugs to validate myself, and she doesn't require me to abstain to appease her own self-interest.  We are compatible and sensible with each other.  This is how we are and I wouldn't change her, and she doesn't need to change me. \n However I have a problem with your story.  Why do you feel the need to validate yourself by pressuring her to use these substances the way you do?  It's obvious she has no interest.  On the other hand she is asking the same of you from a different perspective, that you abstain like her.  It's obvious you have no interest to change either. \n There's your answer, staring you right in the face.  If you have experienced such incompatibility on such regular intervals over the same issue which neither of you have an interest in changing, then stop beating yourself up.  Give up on this rollercoaster because it is emotionally draining and hurtful for both of you.  You are young, probably intelligent, and have a lot of time ahead of you.  Learn from this and be yourself.  You are yourself, she is herself, and if either has to change to fit the other's expectations, when these expectations are unreal, then be yourself by yourself and not what she wants you to be.  I don't think you're going to be able to compromise with your current attitude about drugs.  You need to find somebody less hung up on your drug use, and you also need to reexamine why you need her so badly to \"try before you say no\" to validate your own use.  You yourself validate your own actions, no one else.  Own that and get yourself out of this relationship before you damage yourselves even further. \n There are millions of other girls out there who could make a better match for you.  Probably an older you, because I think I've been you and I think you still have some growing up to do before you commit to long term relationships especially ones as emotionally draining as this one.  You're only 23 and you've been with her since 18?  I've seen this happen in my own friends' relationships and it's usually an impediment to adulthood.  Think about it, you've been together since you were children.  You've become emotionally dependent on each other even though you're both growing up into very different adults.  Time to move on and into your own adulthood and stop holding each other back.

This is going to come as a bit of a shock to you because his perspectives can seem quite extreme particularly to someone who is used to putting human rights ahead of all other animal rights. \n Nevertheless, Peter Singer's approach is one of utilitarianism. The idea is that veganism is concerned with doing the least amount of harm possible. As another poster pointed out, there is no necessary opposition between the life of an animal and the life of a human, insofar as a human can eat vegetarian foods now'a'days and leave the animal alone completely. In this instance, you can minimize the harm done to an animal (by not killing it, subjecting it to cruelty, etc) without increasing the harm done to you in any material way (I mean, so what if you don't eat meat). \n Vegans therefore avoid animal products to minimize harm. Follow me so far? You could argue that if a chicken lives a plush and happy life, a vegan should be okay with eating eggs the chicken produces. In some cases, they ARE okay with this - I have known vegans who may selectively eat eggs if they know the farm and know the chickens were well cared for and not subjected to any harm. But this isn't about veganism, this is about abortion rights. \n So I can see how you could turn this back on me: how is terminating a pregnancy minimizing harm? Well this is a complicated question. For starters, consider the exemption sane pro-lifers give in instances of rape or incest. The idea here is that carrying the baby to term will be so cruel to the woman, so emotionally painful, that terminating the pregnancy is a logically acceptable answer. The woman may not be ready for parenthood, and the infant could have a difficult life because the mother lacks resources necessary to properly care for a child. Carrying the child to term could be just as cruel to the child as to the mother, as the child may not enjoy the loving support it needs to live a fulfilling life. Everyone suffers. \n Likewise, if the mother's life is at risk (such as ectopic pregnancy) - the woman could go on to bear HEALTHY children later in life that won't kill her. Forcing her to have a child that is guaranteed to terminate her life is not minimizing harm. \n The question is where to draw the line, then. Pro-choice advocates don't think that women should go out having abortions left and right. Nobody enjoys having abortions - it can be a difficult experience. But if a mother believes that having the child will be a net negative for herself and for the child - if the child is virtually guaranteed to have a difficult life because of the mother's current situation, or because it could harm the mother, because the mother did not intend to have a child and it would ruin her life to take care of the child - these might be valid reasons that having an abortion minimizes harm. \n Saying that abortion should be illegal under all circumstances (or only in an extremely limited subset) denies women the ability to minimize harm in some circumstances. The idea here is that state shouldn't be able to decide what is best for a woman's life, as the woman is the only one in a good position to make that call. \n Obviously, the preferred solution is to make access to birth control easy, to keep the public WELL EDUCATED (none of this \"abstinence is the only 100% effective method\" bullshit), and you will reduce abortions a HUGE amount. \n Anyway, if your ethical viewpoint is that all human life is absolutely to be protected under all circumstances, you may reach situations where your requirement of protecting human life makes people suffer greatly. Consider end-of-life care for terminal cancer patients. If the patient is in immense physical pain with no hope of recovery, would you require that they attempt to stay alive as long as possible, or would you be all right with them dying on their own terms? I'm not saying this is analogous to pregnancy, I'm just saying that there are some circumstances where an ethos that requires you to protect human life is NOT the same as protecting the QUALITY of human life. In some circumstances, a conflict might arise where the latter becomes just as important as the former, and the pro-choice argument is that the state shouldn't have a hand in deciding for someone individually.", "tokens": [11980, 345, 1683, 1100, 5613, 28755, 30, 770, 318, 1016, 284, 1282, 355, 257, 1643, 286, 257, 6380, 284, 345, 780, 465, 22582, 460, 1283, 2407, 3257, 3573, 284, 2130, 508, 318, 973, 284, 5137, 1692, 2489, 4058, 286, 477, 584, 5044, 2489, 13, 220, 198, 15933, 11, 5613, 28755, 338, 3164, 318, 530, 286, 48239, 1042, 13, 383, 2126, 318, 326, 15169, 1042, 318, 5213, 351, 1804, 262, 1551, 2033, 286, 4419, 1744, 13, 1081, 1194, 11968, 6235, 503, 11, 612, 318, 645, 3306, 5471, 1022, 262, 1204, 286, 281, 5044, 290, 262, 1204, 286, 257, 1692, 11, 44061, 355, 257, 1692, 460, 4483, 24053, 9013, 783, 6, 64, 1549, 592, 290, 2666, 262, 5044, 3436, 3190, 13, 554, 428, 4554, 11, 345, 460, 17775, 262, 4419, 1760, 284, 281, 5044, 357, 1525, 407, 5170, 340, 11, 2426, 278, 340, 284, 23152, 11, 3503, 8, 1231, 3649, 262, 4419, 1760, 284, 345, 287, 597, 2587, 835, 357, 40, 1612, 11, 523, 644, 611, 345, 836, 470, 4483, 6174, 737, 220, 198, 8427, 504, 4361, 3368, 5044, 3186, 284, 17775, 4419, 13, 7281, 502, 523, 1290, 30, 921, 714, 7267, 326, 611, 257, 9015, 3160, 257, 46336, 290, 3772, 1204, 11, 257, 15169, 815, 307, 8788, 351, 6600, 9653, 262, 9015, 11073, 13, 554, 617, 2663, 11, 484, 15986, 8788, 351, 428, 532, 314, 423, 1900, 1569, 39352, 508, 743, 39119, 4483, 9653, 611, 484, 760, 262, 5318, 290, 760, 262, 25972, 547, 880, 19951, 329, 290, 407, 16164, 284, 597, 4419, 13, 887, 428, 2125, 470, 546, 15169, 1042, 11, 428, 318, 546, 7950, 2489, 13, 220, 198, 1406, 314, 460, 766, 703, 345, 714, 1210, 428, 736, 319, 502, 25, 703, 318, 47985, 257, 10241, 41366, 4419, 30, 3894, 428, 318, 257, 8253, 1808, 13, 1114, 19896, 11, 2074, 262, 19572, 33241, 386, 12, 36195, 364, 1577, 287, 10245, 286, 7262, 393, 35961, 13, 383, 2126, 994, 318, 326, 6872, 262, 5156, 284, 3381, 481, 307, 523, 12177, 284, 262, 2415, 11, 523, 17991, 12132, 11, 326, 47985, 262, 10241, 318, 257, 34193, 10909, 3280, 13, 383, 2415, 743, 407, 307, 3492, 329, 279, 17117, 11, 290, 262, 11212, 714, 423, 257, 2408, 1204, 780, 262, 2802, 16523, 4133, 3306, 284, 6105, 1337, 329, 257, 1200, 13, 1879, 14992, 262, 1200, 284, 3381, 714, 307, 655, 355, 12177, 284, 262, 1200, 355, 284, 262, 2802, 11, 355, 262, 1200, 743, 407, 2883, 262, 14442, 1104, 340, 2476, 284, 2107, 257, 26187, 1204, 13, 11075, 21046, 13, 220, 198, 22660, 11, 611, 262, 2802, 338, 1204, 318, 379, 2526, 357, 10508, 355, 46080, 16603, 10241, 8, 532, 262, 2415, 714, 467, 319, 284, 6842, 11179, 40818, 56, 1751, 1568, 287, 1204, 326, 1839, 470, 1494, 607, 13, 1114, 2259, 607, 284, 423, 257, 1200, 326, 318, 11462, 284, 23654, 607, 1204, 318, 407, 41366, 4419, 13, 220, 198, 383, 1808, 318, 810, 284, 3197, 262, 1627, 11, 788, 13, 1041, 12, 25541, 11009, 836, 470, 892, 326, 1466, 815, 467, 503, 1719, 19985, 1364, 290, 826, 13, 15658, 20393, 1719, 19985], "length": 512}, {"text": "The Narrative of HL1 can lead you to believe that this was Black Mesa's first visit to Xen.

That could be because I had already known of the coming plot twists, but that hasn't really mattered in any other anime I've watched thus far, nor did it affect my reactions in the Edolas scenes, which in truth were not as sad as the one in the end of Oracion Seis.", "tokens": [51, 789, 286, 9538, 2492, 470, 1049, 8384, 780, 340, 373, 262, 938, 10389, 284, 3895, 262, 2089, 46823, 22407, 329, 3434, 290, 884, 11, 290, 262, 3092, 286, 2910, 326, 4329, 257, 1103, 10038, 11868, 618, 5256, 4496, 468, 607, 717, 1103, 1688, 10181, 326, 561, 761, 340, 13, 220, 198, 1471, 49443, 1001, 271, 319, 262, 584, 1021, 373, 655, 257, 3236, 1309, 866, 319, 13630, 262, 1621, 13, 383, 1517, 318, 616, 4459, 319, 428, 10389, 1244, 307, 257, 1310, 21925, 11, 355, 379, 428, 966, 314, 4966, 503, 286, 8640, 290, 3421, 284, 3555, 262, 15911, 13, 3244, 618, 2406, 736, 284, 2342, 262, 8640, 340, 373, 517, 10678, 644, 5087, 547, 4814, 422, 262, 11984, 290, 326, 5676, 616, 5009, 319, 262, 2168, 13, 2735, 6189, 340, 550, 663, 7188, 11, 449, 5330, 338, 1907, 351, 367, 1258, 5948, 373, 845, 880, 925, 11, 475, 2592, 262, 11418, 319, 262, 1568, 9539, 3947, 881, 4785, 319, 11984, 5794, 13, 22162, 338, 290, 5256, 4496, 338, 11418, 547, 407, 326, 880, 1760, 290, 262, 2457, 1907, 373, 925, 257, 43671, 1643, 1165, 1162, 3281, 3688, 284, 262, 15911, 13, 220, 198, 887, 262, 1103, 11868, 373, 262, 1109, 326, 262, 11984, 338, 7585, 286, 262, 7016, 3404, 379, 262, 886, 373, 655, 8631, 4785, 621, 262, 15911, 338, 13, 1320, 714, 307, 780, 314, 550, 1541, 1900, 286, 262, 2406, 7110, 30953, 11, 475, 326, 5818, 470, 1107, 33343, 287, 597, 584, 11984, 314, 1053, 7342, 4145, 1290, 11, 4249, 750, 340, 2689, 616, 12737, 287, 262, 1717, 12456, 8188, 11, 543, 287, 3872, 547, 407, 355, 6507, 355, 262, 530, 287, 262, 886, 286, 1471, 49443, 1001, 271, 13], "length": 284}, {"text": "This reminds me of this gal I met in Atlanta, Georgia. She was cute with emerald eyes, and seemed to be very into me. I decided I would do well with my A-game deployed. All I had to do was be quiet, nod from time to time, and smile occasionally. \n I know myself very well; when I start talking, the vaginas within earshot tend to dry out like smeared boogers under a computer chair. My methods may seem out of the ordinary, but I have learned to trust and depend on my looks. My soul is ugly, but she won't notice as long as I keep a lid on it. \n The night goes well and she is all over my arm. I am still quiet and sometimes I have to deftly tuck my dong under my belt to avoid being mistaken as some jerk. We decide her place is where we'll go and off we went. This night my luck would change! \n We get to her apartment and it smells like testicles after basketball practice. No big deal, at least she had a tidy place. We lay on the couch after putting any movie into the DVD player. Started kissing, and other stuff adults are notorious for. \n As I am getting some neck, her iguana climbs slowly on to my back. (She lets it roam free; this explains the odor.) \"Oh look! It's Q-Ball!\" She says cheerfully. She grabs him off of my back and his claws scratch me all to hell. \"Uhh. Hello there, Q-Ball...\" I said concealing my irritation. We stop making out and she delivers a lengthy introduction to the huge lizard. I'm pretty sure Q-Ball knows my name, favorite color, and birthday at this point. \n \"Wanna feed him!?\" she asked enthusiastically. \"Yeah, that'd be cool!\" I replied as genuinely as I could. No one appreciates being cock-blocked by a reptile. It's not like I felt inadequate, I know damn well I can please a woman better than some scaly tree crawler. We fed Q-Ball chunks of squash and that's when she dropped the bomb on me. \n \"He really likes you. But we can't do anything tonight. Q-Ball has been with me a long time and he's got my six. We should wait and get to know each other better first. I'm sure you understand.\" she said. I just shrugged and pecked her on the cheek. \"Of course I understand. I'm glad you have a friend in Q-Ball.\" I said rather convincingly. \n We've been dating for a few months now and just last night I finally got to seal the deal with her. She was amazing in bed! But she insisted Q-Ball had to watch us because she couldn't get aroused unless she knew she was safe. If that girl ever cheats on me, it will be with Q-Ball, I just know it.

The world's wealth is not a zero-sum game. It's the same reason that people can invest in the stock market long term and ALWAYS expect growth (over years, possibly decades). The economy grows. \n An easy example is the homeless. Even now, at the local shelter I work at, every homeless person has had some fast food within the week and has access to a cellular phone. Either their own or their family's. The poor of today have it incredibly better than the poor of a hundred years ago. Look at all the leisure time we have now in the middle class and lower class. I have a family friend who farmed back in the day. He had maybe 2-3 hours a day, from age 12 to 30, of \"free\" time. Nowadays his kids, in the same farm, have 4+ hours/day, including school. \n Most American kids have some access to education. Some social welfare program. Something. Compare that with a century ago. 150 years ago in the start of the Industrial Age people had a life expectancy of less than 40 years because of the lack of regulation and laws. Things are improving. The economy is NOT a zero-sum game. Ever heard of the rule of 72? Yeah, your real wealth as a country doubles once every generation or so (at least in developing countries). Where do you get these figures you're saying? What is the majority of the world? How are they in despair? I was perfectly happy being poor when I was younger in a developing country. I'm just as happy, maybe less, once I became (relatively) successful. Also, I don't know what gas tanks you're talking about. I think the highest end sport-yacht is the Cigarette, costing a little under a million. I sincerely doubt they spend as much to top off the gas tank as the yacht costs. \n Believe it or not, this is not a bad time to be poor at all. Google it if you don't believe me.

I follow her gaze to see this terrible scene: A bridge over a gaping ravine has collapsed and cars are still driving off the edge and crashing into the river beneath. People are dying right before my eyes, screaming, crying. My ears are filled with a terrible screeching sound louder than any other sobbing and I'm suddenly underneath the bridge looking up. \n I turn around and there's a little girl laying on the river-bank, she's making the screeching sound.

I expected to hear my dogs barking due to the noise I made, but there was nothing.  I walk through the hallway, turn my head to the right and see my parents' bedroom door is closed.  I figure they're asleep, so I turn around.  As soon as I was facing the opposite direction, I see my sister in a chair, dead, eyes open but lifeless, and fucking Slender Man behind her, and even with his featureless face, I could sense every bit fear-inducing aura built up within him as if he'd done this same thing to thousands of people in their nightmares since the dawn of man.  I yelled out her name in the dream, waking myself up with the sound of me actually yelling it in the real world.  I shot straight up in my bed, sobbing, yelling out my sister's name as if it were something from a movie.  That one nightmare singlehandedly scared me more than anything else in my entire life.", "tokens": [40, 765, 284, 910, 428, 373, 546, 734, 2745, 2084, 11, 714, 307, 1342, 11, 475, 314, 4398, 470, 587, 11029, 845, 881, 16537, 290, 262, 1528, 389, 3599, 284, 23671, 1978, 13, 220, 2011, 4320, 2067, 572, 2407, 3487, 11, 1016, 284, 5385, 4113, 290, 4379, 661, 314, 2993, 13, 220, 2102, 11, 314, 788, 1816, 832, 257, 3420, 290, 4444, 510, 319, 262, 3504, 286, 262, 33078, 2354, 616, 1459, 20994, 11, 4979, 407, 772, 41656, 284, 2230, 284, 3368, 502, 13, 220, 632, 2936, 588, 9734, 26679, 13, 220, 21836, 11, 314, 1625, 284, 262, 7664, 326, 314, 815, 655, 2513, 1363, 284, 616, 1468, 2156, 543, 318, 546, 11546, 4608, 422, 810, 314, 2107, 783, 13, 220, 383, 2104, 835, 736, 11, 314, 2540, 1642, 510, 3923, 284, 1394, 3589, 34988, 290, 7599, 1625, 2402, 262, 2126, 286, 4441, 257, 649, 4469, 329, 616, 938, 1438, 11, 2406, 510, 351, 12796, 290, 511, 3923, 329, 1123, 3850, 287, 616, 938, 1438, 13, 220, 36651, 314, 4444, 510, 287, 616, 9963, 6232, 287, 2258, 5913, 11, 475, 616, 2156, 287, 4744, 550, 6928, 262, 2156, 612, 13, 220, 3887, 1657, 287, 262, 6232, 373, 572, 13, 220, 1400, 4675, 75, 9430, 11, 645, 33179, 7588, 11, 262, 5788, 290, 8824, 547, 3750, 355, 880, 13, 220, 13248, 306, 3223, 11, 290, 262, 18787, 373, 3726, 284, 5806, 502, 866, 13, 220, 314, 3443, 925, 340, 284, 616, 2156, 290, 6807, 287, 262, 2166, 3420, 13, 220, 314, 2938, 284, 3285, 616, 6844, 48961, 2233, 284, 262, 7838, 314, 925, 11, 475, 612, 373, 2147, 13, 220, 314, 2513, 832, 262, 23959, 11, 1210, 616, 1182, 284, 262, 826, 290, 766, 616, 3397, 6, 14043, 3420, 318, 4838, 13, 220, 314, 3785, 484, 821, 16039, 11, 523, 314, 1210, 1088, 13, 220, 1081, 2582, 355, 314, 373, 6476, 262, 6697, 4571, 11, 314, 766, 616, 6621, 287, 257, 5118, 11, 2636, 11, 2951, 1280, 475, 46443, 11, 290, 9372, 3454, 2194, 1869, 2157, 607, 11, 290, 772, 351, 465, 3895, 1203, 1986, 11, 314, 714, 2565, 790, 1643, 3252, 12, 48016, 22491, 3170, 510, 1626, 683, 355, 611, 339, 1549, 1760, 428, 976, 1517, 284, 4138, 286, 661, 287, 511, 33301, 1201, 262, 17577, 286, 582, 13, 220, 314, 22760, 503, 607, 1438, 287, 262, 4320, 11, 23137, 3589, 510, 351, 262, 2128, 286, 502, 1682, 22187, 340, 287, 262, 1103, 995, 13, 220, 314, 2823, 3892, 510, 287, 616, 3996, 11, 27355, 4623, 11, 22187, 503, 616, 6621, 338, 1438, 355, 611, 340, 547, 1223, 422, 257, 3807, 13, 220, 1320, 530, 17123, 2060, 43919, 12008, 502, 517, 621, 1997, 2073, 287, 616, 2104, 1204, 13], "length": 449}]
