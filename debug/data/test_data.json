For the most part I liked the changes Bioware made to the other classes. Commandos & Sages got buffs where they needed it, DPS Scoundrels got some love (though still not enough imo), and I'm even fine with the Assault Vanguard nerfs to be honest. But the buff to Focus spec baffled me for the longest time when I read it. I think if anything, most heavy PvPers (including Focus spec players) were expecting it to be hit with a nerf 1.4, instead it's the other way around. \n Everyone knows Focus Guardians (and to a lesser extent Sentinels) do the expected insane amounts of total damage (AOE spec, no big surprise) but what's crazy is that they'll often also have the biggest single hit in warzones, because of the way they can Force Stasis/Choke (skill tree node) and Leap in (Vindicator set bonus) to get extra damage + guaranteed crit (skill tree node). I'm fully augmented WH with optimized mods/enhancements and I'm lucky to hit 5.5k against BM and above opponents. I've screenshots of Guardians doing up to 6.7k in those same warzones while also surpassing me in total damage. And Bioware is buffing them so they can Smash even  more  often? \n It wasn't until I talked to a friend who does PvE (which I almost never do) that he explained it's a PvE buff. Focus spec lags super hard (around 15-20% according to DPS parsers) behind Vigilance for Guardians and the other 2 DPS trees for Sentinels in PvE. So they upping the frequency of Sweep to make up for this. \n Here's where I see 2 problems: \n 1) I doubt this is even gonna fix the PvE issue. A big part of Focus specs problem in PvE is the fact it's AOE and it'll wake up and hit all CC'd targets along with taking threat away from the tank that the tank might not have heavily taunted/attacked at that point. I have a feeling most dedicated PvErs are still gonna stick with the other specs because it's safer and does damage just fine. \n 2) I understand in PvE, Focus spec is underwhelming against a boss with 500k - 1mill-k HP. The sustain just isn't there (pre 1.4). But in PvP burst is king and against players with 15k-20k health, hitting for 5k-6.5k damage every 15 seconds against everybody around them is VERY VERY GOOD. And now it's gonna get even better. \n I'm just gonna go out on a limb and say next few weeks Warzones are gonna be a bit rough when more and more ppl realize how strong Focus spec is post 1.4 and until it becomes an obvious enough issue that Bioware needs to balance patch this.", "tokens": [3673, 1654, 611, 428, 1487, 468, 587, 6411, 6693, 994, 475, 314, 892, 428, 318, 8066, 307, 262, 4094, 11, 749, 555, 6893, 5077, 1487, 287, 25576, 287, 352, 13, 19, 13, 1114, 262, 749, 636, 314, 8288, 262, 2458, 8436, 322, 533, 925, 284, 262, 584, 6097, 13, 9455, 418, 1222, 311, 1095, 1392, 34636, 810, 484, 2622, 340, 11, 25366, 1446, 633, 2411, 82, 1392, 617, 1842, 357, 2016, 991, 407, 1576, 545, 78, 828, 290, 314, 1101, 772, 3734, 351, 262, 15590, 31507, 17156, 9501, 284, 307, 5508, 13, 887, 262, 6940, 284, 17061, 1020, 44432, 502, 329, 262, 14069, 640, 618, 314, 1100, 340, 13, 314, 892, 611, 1997, 11, 749, 4334, 25576, 364, 357, 8201, 17061, 1020, 1938, 8, 547, 12451, 340, 284, 307, 2277, 351, 257, 17156, 69, 352, 13, 19, 11, 2427, 340, 338, 262, 584, 835, 1088, 13, 220, 198, 11075, 4206, 17061, 19752, 357, 392, 284, 257, 14494, 6287, 11352, 259, 1424, 8, 466, 262, 2938, 13251, 6867, 286, 2472, 2465, 357, 32, 27799, 1020, 11, 645, 1263, 5975, 8, 475, 644, 338, 7165, 318, 326, 484, 1183, 1690, 635, 423, 262, 4094, 2060, 2277, 287, 1175, 89, 1952, 11, 780, 286, 262, 835, 484, 460, 5221, 520, 17765, 14, 1925, 2088, 357, 42401, 5509, 10139, 8, 290, 33927, 287, 357, 53, 521, 26407, 900, 7202, 8, 284, 651, 3131, 2465, 1343, 11462, 1955, 357, 42401, 5509, 10139, 737, 314, 1101, 3938, 30259, 7655, 351, 23392, 13743, 14, 16550, 590, 902, 290, 314, 1101, 9670, 284, 2277], "length": 256}, {"text": "Well, lets see.

I was walking into the sliding door and said \"Hey Pup!\" and patted him on the head. At that point I was bitten and grabbed, as you know those jaws are bred for, I am sure. The only family member he would listen to was the youngest child and he was not there. I had 3 grown men remove the dog and say,\" I am so sorry- we keep him hungry so he will hunt better, and keep him outdoors so he will be acclimated to all weather. I did not blame the dog. That was his life; how he was brought up. I blamed the father of my friend who owned him who disregarded the dog as a pet and trained him in a small backyard with children to fight, hunt, starve and get rained on, etc. The poor dog had to be quarantined for a few days because of the supposed snake bite encounter, and I got threats from the owner saying I roughed up his dog and got him going, which i most certainly did not. I lost 2 friends that night (they were also sons of the dog owner), had ER bills and a permanent scar. But no, I know that was the way that poor guy was raised.

When there are fundamentalists out there that believe atheists should be registered like sex offenders, a lie can many times allay the fears  of being \"found out\" and ostracized or confronted or discriminated against. \n Also, while I sort of understand your Buddhist conversions argument, another problem with the survey is that it's not asking about beliefs, but about religions. People have a desire to be a part of something bigger than the individual and will reach out to religion many times to fill that void. It doesn't mean that atheists suddenly believe in a god, it means they want something more than what they have had. Sometimes it's pantheism, paganism, deism, atheistic Buddhism, etc. \n I once embraced Buddhism as a \"way of life\" and rejected the notion that it was a religion. During that time, I still believed in a higher power and eventually went back to Christianity before shedding all supernatural beliefs and openly stating my atheism (to myself and close friends only due to fear of rejection from my family). If I went back to Buddhism now, as an atheist, I still wouldn't believe in a god or higher power and yet may chose to label myself as a Buddhist. That doesn't mean that I'm not also an atheist. And  this  is why the survey is flawed. It simply asks what were you raised and what do you consider yourself now and if there is a change, it's set as a hit against the initial group. \n Where's Universal Unitarian? Pagan? Secular humanism? Any other association with belief and not religion? Remember, people like labels.
