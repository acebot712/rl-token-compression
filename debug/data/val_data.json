But I don't think it's necessarily as bad as you might think.  In fact, if you're offended by drug related crime, you should probably be in favor of casual users stock piling around that much... \n See, if you smoke on the regular, that much weed is still going to run out.  You're not going to use 700 grams all at once, so that volume has to be judged by consumption rate and accessibility of resupply.  That resin  might be his absolute primo stash that he dips into on rare occasion, and if he can only resupply every 3 years....  Basically, for some smokers (all day, erry day, amiright?), 700 grams can be 'just enough' and then they are totally satisfied in terms of drug transactions for a long while. \n Which brings me back to crime: since we can't keep even drugs out of super max prisons, let's work under the assumption that people are still going to be able to score on occasion.  Do we want lots of drug transactions with lots of hard to prosecute interactions, easy cash flow, and low costs of entry to the market combined with high investigatory costs?  Or do we want an industry that requires deep pockets to play around in (providing legal surface area and related assets), is continually dealing in significant volumes (minimizing the number of players), and with a minimum number of targets to legislate, investigate, and regulate all while having a more predictable supply to minimize market opportunity to new entrants? \n Smokers going out and scoring here and there keeps the drug war broad and wide, and punishes responsible users who get hit with disproportionate penalties for living their lives in a more law abiding manner.  And the only upside is more drug dealers who exist in an easier, more profitable, market.   Home or regional growers supplying large volumes of nationally grown weed to residential users for personal use (through the mail for example), would be indistinguishable from our current drug  use  situation, but would give us a fighting chance to eliminate the violent crime aspect of prohibition.  It also provides a reasonable framework for full taxation and national price competition (putting unsustainable cost pressure on illegal dealers), and can even be extended (through NAFTA), to deny  billions  of dollars every year to central and south american crime syndicates.", "tokens": [2202, 262, 1986, 286, 340, 11, 10194, 11, 13037, 16379, 318, 257, 1256, 13, 220, 887, 314, 836, 470, 892, 340, 338, 6646, 355, 2089, 355, 345, 1244, 892, 13, 220, 554, 1109, 11, 611, 345, 821, 22231, 416, 2563, 3519, 4065, 11, 345, 815, 2192, 307, 287, 2661, 286, 9341, 2985, 4283, 48060, 1088, 326, 881, 986, 220, 198, 4091, 11, 611, 345, 7523, 319, 262, 3218, 11, 326, 881, 20349, 318, 991, 1016, 284, 1057, 503, 13, 220, 921, 821, 407, 1016, 284, 779, 13037, 16379, 477, 379, 1752, 11, 523, 326, 6115, 468, 284, 307, 19589, 416, 7327, 2494, 290, 28969, 286, 581, 7211, 306, 13, 220, 1320, 36536, 220, 1244, 307, 465, 4112, 2684, 78, 38305, 326, 339, 48904, 656, 319, 4071, 6695, 11, 290, 611, 339, 460, 691, 581, 7211, 306, 790, 513, 812, 1106, 220, 20759, 11, 329, 617, 24109, 357, 439, 1110, 11, 1931, 563, 1110, 11, 716, 343, 432, 33924, 13037, 16379, 460, 307, 705, 3137, 1576, 6, 290, 788, 484, 389, 6635, 11378, 287, 2846, 286, 2563, 8945, 329, 257, 890, 981, 13, 220, 198, 9022, 6774, 502, 736, 284, 4065, 25, 1201, 356, 460, 470, 1394, 772, 5010, 503, 286, 2208, 3509, 19224, 11, 1309, 338, 670, 739, 262, 13196, 326, 661, 389, 991, 1016, 284, 307, 1498, 284, 4776, 319, 6695, 13, 220, 2141, 356, 765, 6041, 286, 2563, 8945, 351, 6041, 286, 1327, 284, 26057, 12213, 11, 2562, 5003, 5202, 11, 290, 1877, 3484, 286, 5726, 284, 262, 1910, 5929, 351, 1029, 2009, 2870, 3484, 30, 220, 1471, 466, 356, 765, 281, 2831, 326, 4433, 2769, 16511, 284, 711, 1088, 287, 357, 15234, 2530, 2742, 4417, 1989, 290, 3519, 6798, 828, 318, 17451, 7219, 287, 2383, 15343, 357, 1084, 320, 2890, 262, 1271, 286, 1938, 828, 290, 351, 257, 5288, 1271, 286, 6670, 284, 3560, 378, 11, 9161, 11, 290, 16697, 477, 981, 1719, 257, 517, 20039, 5127, 284, 17775, 1910, 3663, 284, 649, 49117, 30, 220, 198, 2439, 18698, 1016, 503, 290, 9689, 994, 290, 612, 7622, 262, 2563, 1175, 3154, 290, 3094, 11, 290, 4000, 5614, 4497, 2985, 508, 651, 2277, 351, 30982, 12970, 329, 2877, 511, 3160, 287, 257, 517, 1099, 48637, 5642, 13, 220, 843, 262, 691, 17196, 318, 517, 2563, 15737, 508, 2152, 287, 281, 4577, 11, 517, 17967, 11, 1910, 13, 220, 220, 5995, 393, 7915, 33527, 28099, 1588, 15343, 286, 18845, 7334, 20349, 284, 12420, 2985, 329, 2614, 779, 357, 9579, 262, 6920, 329, 1672, 828, 561, 307, 43649, 422, 674, 1459, 2563, 220, 779, 220, 3074, 11, 475, 561, 1577, 514, 257, 4330, 2863, 284, 11005, 262, 6590, 4065, 4843, 286, 19548, 13, 220, 632, 635, 3769, 257, 6397, 9355, 329, 1336, 21843, 290, 2260, 2756, 5449, 357, 1996, 889, 39554, 1575, 3833, 319, 5293, 15737, 828, 290, 460, 772, 307, 7083, 357, 9579, 34747, 828, 284, 10129, 220, 13188, 220, 286, 5054, 790, 614, 284, 4318, 290, 5366, 45630, 272, 4065, 11150, 16856, 13], "length": 495}, {"text": "I feel obliged to say that doing it properly makes a huge difference.

Is that how onboard sound works? \n If you have the O2+ODAC, there is no good reason to do this, as you will not be utilizing the ODAC, which you have paid for. \n In terms of distortion: The signal is going to be no better than the quality of your soundcard, but the O2 will provide enough power to drive difficult headphones, and may still sound massively better than the headphone jack on your PC due to driving the headphones properly.", "tokens": [1462, 787, 6067, 4785, 314, 2107, 287, 649, 27689, 392, 11, 1406, 314, 423, 284, 635, 2822, 257, 2239, 866, 47385, 284, 772, 651, 262, 1517, 2491, 1231, 19280, 340, 510, 13, 1052, 5789, 4896, 1058, 34729, 220, 198, 5740, 329, 2687, 2073, 16216, 262, 440, 17, 393, 440, 17, 10, 3727, 2246, 25, 1649, 345, 1502, 422, 4551, 49915, 4013, 23968, 873, 11, 484, 481, 5127, 257, 1176, 5127, 351, 262, 3376, 15004, 329, 534, 1499, 13, 220, 770, 1724, 326, 345, 460, 651, 1497, 351, 257, 3067, 21302, 2427, 286, 7067, 281, 5000, 649, 48189, 329, 340, 13, 220, 198, 1875, 532, 1532, 314, 973, 257, 513, 13, 20, 284, 513, 13, 20, 7862, 284, 2018, 262, 440, 17, 284, 616, 6177, 8202, 9795, 311, 15919, 11, 561, 429, 314, 307, 1233, 24707, 357, 2502, 12306, 4035, 10091, 616, 2647, 30, 1148, 326, 703, 25863, 2128, 2499, 30, 220, 198, 1002, 345, 423, 262, 440, 17, 10, 3727, 2246, 11, 612, 318, 645, 922, 1738, 284, 466, 428, 11, 355, 345, 481, 407, 307, 25137, 262, 31245, 2246, 11, 543, 345, 423, 3432, 329, 13, 220, 198, 554, 2846, 286, 25100, 25, 383, 6737, 318, 1016, 284, 307, 645, 1365, 621, 262, 3081, 286, 534, 2128, 9517, 11, 475, 262, 440, 17, 481, 2148, 1576, 1176, 284, 3708, 2408, 22537, 11, 290, 743, 991, 2128, 28161, 1365, 621, 262, 36769, 14509, 319, 534, 4217, 2233, 284, 5059, 262, 22537, 6105, 13], "length": 243}, {"text": "14 years experience here. It's not about what you do, it is how you do it. Many guilds base themselves on what they do instead of how they do it. \n Example: You want to do PvP. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of guilds out there that do PvP. That is -what- you do. \nNow -how- do you do it? Figure that out and keep it as your guild signature. If the -how- is that you train your members, teach them, have set trainers, accept complete newbies and show them the ropes using training sessions. Then that is how you do it, how you get the team together, how you keep the team ready for battle etc. \n Some people will like this and join up with you and stay with you because of that. Others will not like this and leave and join someone else. \n Those might join, for example, a guild where there is no training, no newbies are accepted and everyone plays at around the same level and the leader curses and yells at the members when they do something wrong, calling it tough love. Some members will leave because of this and join the first guild, others will like the bootcamp style ordering around stay in this guild. Both are pvp guilds. \n Another example for the pvp guild would be the seemingly random BYOB guild that focuses heavily on activity. Something is -always- happening. The BYOB nature of the guild means new techniques may be discovered but it also means it will lose a lot of matches because.. BYOB. (Bring Your Own Build) \n Another (probably better) explanation of what I mean with \"how\" is.. How do you handle internal conflicts? They -will- happen. \nMy guild, The Order of the Black Lion investigates conflicts by taking everyone separate. We have a set procedure for that. Other guilds put all parties together and work it out by talking. We separate and work it out based on facts we get. We then do psychological mumbojumbo and fix stuff. \nSome guilds trust the older member over the newer member or trust higher ranked officers over lower ranked members. That works too. Not sure if it works well, but it works. I'm biased towards keeping everyone same level. Oh and regarding officers... \n This too is all about the -how- and the personality and signature of your guild. How do you pick officers? What are your officers for? Some guilds give officer positions to the first 10 members who join. I've never joined or had any dealing with those types of guilds so I don't know how effective that is (ahem). Other guilds have the officers be personal friends of the guild leader. It makes sense for the leader to make his friends officers because he knows them and can \"trust\" them. But not everyone who is a friend is a good officer. \nIn my guild, officer positions are temporary job-like positions given to people who do the thing we expect the officer to do anyway or are capable of doing it. \nSome guilds have their officers be long time members or members who are good at what they do etc. \n Another thing: the leader. What you do is PvP. How you manage stuff, how you do things is what defines what the guild is like. Change the leader to someone else and the guild changes fundamentally. The leader is the foundation. You set the identity, you set what the guild does. \n Members will come and go but the ones who identify with your guild are the ones who will stay, the ones who don't, will leave. And that is ok. \n Because of this, you are the guardian, the one who safeguards the guild, the one who leads its progression. Basically the one who leads. Obviously. \nIf the guild changes into a direction your core member don't identify with or don't feel part of, you lose those members. You will get new ones but it won't be the same. What I mean is that when you set the identity, you also have to keep it, uphold it, etc. That's stability.", "tokens": [1415, 812, 1998, 994, 13, 632, 338, 407, 546, 644, 345, 466, 11, 340, 318, 703, 345, 466, 340, 13, 4650, 19806, 82, 2779, 2405, 319, 644, 484, 466, 2427, 286, 703, 484, 466, 340, 13, 220, 198, 17934, 25, 921, 765, 284, 466, 25576, 13, 1318, 389, 5179, 11, 3863, 4138, 286, 19806, 82, 503, 612, 326, 466, 25576, 13, 1320, 318, 532, 10919, 12, 345, 466, 13, 220, 198, 3844, 532, 4919, 12, 466, 345, 466, 340, 30, 11291, 326, 503, 290, 1394, 340, 355, 534, 19806, 9877, 13, 1002, 262, 532, 4919, 12, 318, 326, 345, 4512, 534, 1866, 11, 4545, 606, 11, 423, 900, 28514, 11, 2453, 1844, 649, 29846, 290, 905, 606, 262, 31001, 1262, 3047, 10991, 13, 3244, 326, 318, 703, 345, 466, 340, 11, 703, 345, 651, 262, 1074, 1978, 11, 703, 345, 1394, 262, 1074, 3492, 329, 3344, 3503, 13, 220, 198, 2773, 661, 481, 588, 428, 290, 4654, 510, 351, 345, 290, 2652, 351, 345, 780, 286, 326, 13, 12691, 481, 407, 588, 428, 290, 2666, 290, 4654, 2130, 2073, 13, 220, 198, 5845, 1244, 4654, 11, 329, 1672, 11, 257, 19806, 810, 612, 318, 645, 3047, 11, 645, 649, 29846, 389, 6292, 290, 2506, 5341, 379, 1088, 262, 976, 1241, 290, 262, 3554, 43878, 290, 42675, 379, 262, 1866, 618, 484, 466, 1223, 2642, 11, 4585, 340, 5802, 1842, 13, 2773, 1866, 481, 2666, 780, 286, 428, 290, 4654, 262, 717, 19806, 11, 1854, 481, 588, 262, 6297, 16544, 3918, 16216, 1088, 2652, 287, 428, 19806, 13, 5747, 389, 279, 36133, 19806, 82, 13, 220, 198, 6023, 1672, 329, 262, 279, 36133, 19806, 561, 307, 262, 9775, 4738, 11050, 9864, 19806, 326, 13692, 7272, 319, 3842, 13, 13742, 318, 532, 33770, 12, 5836, 13, 383, 11050, 9864, 3450, 286, 262, 19806, 1724, 649, 7605, 743, 307, 5071, 475, 340, 635, 1724, 340, 481, 4425, 257, 1256, 286, 7466, 780, 492, 11050, 9864, 13, 357, 31416, 3406, 11744, 10934, 8, 220, 198, 6023, 357, 26949, 1365, 8, 7468, 286, 644, 314, 1612, 351, 366, 4919, 1, 318, 492, 1374, 466, 345, 5412, 5387, 12333, 30, 1119, 532, 10594, 12, 1645, 13, 220, 198, 3666, 19806, 11, 383, 8284, 286, 262, 2619, 15218, 44846, 12333, 416, 2263, 2506, 4553, 13, 775, 423, 257, 900, 8771, 329, 326, 13, 3819, 19806, 82, 1234, 477, 4671, 1978, 290, 670, 340, 503, 416, 3375, 13, 775, 4553, 290, 670, 340, 503, 1912, 319, 6419, 356, 651, 13, 775, 788, 466, 10590, 25682, 2127, 73, 29309, 290, 4259, 3404, 13, 220, 198, 4366, 19806, 82, 3774, 262, 4697, 2888, 625, 262, 15064, 2888, 393, 3774, 2440, 10307, 3790, 625, 2793, 10307, 1866, 13, 1320, 2499, 1165, 13, 1892, 1654, 611, 340, 2499, 880, 11, 475, 340, 2499, 13, 314, 1101, 21925, 3371, 5291, 2506, 976, 1241, 13, 3966, 290, 5115, 3790, 986, 220, 198, 770, 1165, 318, 477, 546, 262, 532, 4919, 12, 290, 262, 8806, 290, 9877, 286, 534, 19806, 13, 1374, 466, 345, 2298, 3790, 30, 1867, 389, 534, 3790, 329, 30, 2773, 19806, 82, 1577], "length": 512}, {"text": "Serial killer kidnapped me and a bunch of other people, made us work in a pretend store, and hunted us down.

After three hours nothing had turned up, and we had basically lost hope on the night. Thirty more minutes rolled around and we had long since called it quits, when my other friend said he could get boomers. \"hells yeah!\" I was thinking.... early assumption. My friend comes down to my house and we pile in my car to go get them, only about a twenty minute drive, and we would be getting them from a house so it wasn't at all sketchy. We arrive, and my friend goes in to get them, my best friend and I chat in the car for about five minutes until the other friend comes back. He gets in the car and says, \"you guys are in for a wild night, these are from her personal stash, and they're not psilocybin meniscus.\" To me and my best friend, this was awesome, something we had never tried, something new. \n Anyway we get back to my house and prepare to eat the boomers, we have a Quarter of an ounce to split, of which there was one massive stem and about eight caps. I took the stem and my best friend had the caps. I forgot to mention that these shrooms were super weird looking (for magic mushrooms) and had this weird white powder on the outside. Anyway we scarf them down, and after about eight minutes I was FUCKED up. usually shrooms take about an hour to kick in so this made me a little nervous, but I figured oh well more time to trip. we decide to go on a walk and for the whole journey everything looked like it was in pixels, and the moon looked like the sun in minecraft. we walk back to my house and go down into my basement, throw on adult swim, and converse like we always do on mushrooms. this goes on for about two hours, and is a super good time until my best friend needed to take out his contacts. Now he is really blind, so I can no longer explain what he may be seeing, but I can tell you what I saw. After getting his contacts out, he gets really quiet. This makes me sort of uncomfortable, but I'm on shrooms, so i just rationalize it to the boomers. My belly started to feel upset so I turn to my friend and say, \"want to go smoke a bowl?\" to help me calm it down. He looks at me as if I were satan himself and yells, \"NO!!!\" So being somewhat annoyed at this i went to smoke a cigarette, Finish that up and go back downstairs. I had one of those Arizona dollar fruit punches and I took a drink of it. My friend says in a really sweet voice, \"hey man can I see that?\" I say , \"sure man\" and hand it to him. He takes the can, gives it that same look he gave me, and throws it at my fireplace. Mind you I am tripping harder then I had in a long time, to me time was unfathomable, everything was making intense patterns, so I could do nothing about this but yell, \"WHAT THE FUCK MAN?!\" he just looked at me an stood up, moving towards the stairs. This freaked me out because my parents were sleeping and I did not want to wake them up being on shrooms. So I grabbed my smokes and followed him. He walks up the stairs to the main level in my house and makes a break for the upstairs, at which point I grabbed him, because I did not want him up there. But he pulled away and got upstairs, and into my room. I follow him, but am intercepted by What I saw as a Dementor wearing a pink bathrobe, but was actually my mother. The hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life was give her a hug, because to me she was trying to suck my soul out. she walks downstairs, but to me she is floating, meanwhile my friend is derping around my room. But he sees me and instantly goes straight down the stairs and has a breakdown in front of the door, I push him outside and am walking out myself when my mother says, \"what's wrong?\" to which I respond a sharp, \"NOTHING.\" I close the door and my friend pulls out his pack, grabs a smoke from it, and throws both of them on the ground. he then looks up at me and asks in a snape-like tone, \"can you give me a cigarette?\" So I grab  the one he dropped, put it in his mouth and light it. He proceeds to eat the cigarette, getting the whole filter in his mouth before I can pull it out. At this point, I can't take it anymore, I take him inside, get him a blanket and a pillow, say goodnight and go to my room. i spend the next five hours listening to music and watching my posters move. \n The next morning he Txts me asking what had happened the night before, long conversation ensued.", "tokens": [5661, 318, 1016, 284, 1011, 257, 890, 640, 284, 2099, 1106, 198, 5661, 3931, 502, 290, 616, 1266, 1545, 750, 617, 23452, 11, 475, 777, 23452, 547, 645, 8850, 23452, 13, 220, 198, 1026, 338, 373, 257, 3095, 3931, 1755, 11, 290, 356, 547, 17533, 355, 6678, 11, 523, 852, 262, 2099, 286, 3988, 356, 389, 356, 2067, 2045, 329, 7408, 11, 9022, 318, 1239, 281, 2562, 1064, 13, 2293, 1115, 2250, 2147, 550, 2900, 510, 11, 290, 356, 550, 6209, 2626, 2911, 319, 262, 1755, 13, 29948, 517, 2431, 11686, 1088, 290, 356, 550, 890, 1201, 1444, 340, 627, 896, 11, 618, 616, 584, 1545, 531, 339, 714, 651, 14166, 364, 13, 366, 12758, 82, 10194, 2474, 314, 373, 3612, 1106, 1903, 13196, 13, 2011, 1545, 2058, 866, 284, 616, 2156, 290, 356, 14540, 287, 616, 1097, 284, 467, 651, 606, 11, 691, 546, 257, 8208, 5664, 3708, 11, 290, 356, 561, 307, 1972, 606, 422, 257, 2156, 523, 340, 2492, 470, 379, 477, 17548, 88, 13, 775, 9240, 11, 290, 616, 1545, 2925, 287, 284, 651, 606, 11, 616, 1266, 1545, 290, 314, 8537, 287, 262, 1097, 329, 546, 1936, 2431, 1566, 262, 584, 1545, 2058, 736, 13, 679, 3011, 287, 262, 1097, 290, 1139, 11, 366, 5832, 3730, 389, 287, 329, 257, 4295, 1755, 11, 777, 389, 422, 607, 2614, 38305, 11, 290, 484, 821, 407, 279, 18217, 13733, 8800, 1450, 2304, 385, 526, 1675, 502, 290, 616, 1266, 1545, 11, 428, 373, 7427, 11, 1223, 356, 550, 1239, 3088, 11, 1223, 649, 13, 220, 198, 21836, 356, 651, 736, 284, 616, 2156, 290, 8335, 284, 4483, 262, 14166, 364, 11, 356, 423, 257, 17264, 286, 281, 25799, 284, 6626, 11, 286, 543, 612, 373, 530, 4858, 10717, 290, 546, 3624, 11022, 13, 314, 1718, 262, 10717, 290, 616, 1266, 1545, 550, 262, 11022, 13, 314, 16453, 284, 3068, 326, 777, 427, 9649, 547, 2208, 7650, 2045, 357, 1640, 5536, 23452, 8, 290, 550, 428, 7650, 2330, 11913, 319, 262, 2354, 13, 21836, 356, 36953, 606, 866, 11, 290, 706, 546, 3624, 2431, 314, 373, 30998, 1961, 510, 13, 3221, 427, 9649, 1011, 546, 281, 1711, 284, 4829, 287, 523, 428, 925, 502, 257, 1310, 10927, 11, 475, 314, 11638, 11752, 880, 517, 640, 284, 5296, 13, 356, 5409, 284, 467, 319, 257, 2513, 290, 329, 262, 2187, 7002, 2279, 3114, 588, 340, 373, 287, 17848, 11, 290, 262, 8824, 3114, 588, 262, 4252, 287, 6164, 3323, 13, 356, 2513, 736, 284, 616, 2156, 290, 467, 866, 656, 616, 17012, 11, 3714, 319, 4044, 9422, 11, 290, 369, 4399, 588, 356, 1464, 466, 319, 23452, 13, 428, 2925, 319, 329, 546, 734, 2250, 11, 290, 318, 257, 2208, 922, 640, 1566, 616, 1266, 1545, 2622, 284, 1011, 503, 465, 13961, 13, 2735, 339, 318, 1107, 7770, 11, 523, 314, 460, 645, 2392, 4727, 644, 339, 743, 307, 4379, 11, 475, 314, 460, 1560, 345, 644, 314, 2497, 13, 2293, 1972, 465, 13961, 503, 11, 339, 3011, 1107, 5897, 13, 770, 1838, 502, 3297, 286, 12916, 11, 475, 314, 1101], "length": 512}, {"text": "This on no way helps, but when I lived in campus at a university in Sydney, there was a pair of shoes up on the power lines near our residential building.

The chip damage and the stagger provides time enough for me to get shots off with the Hurricane. This tactic is sufficient enough for me to deal with general enemies. \n But I agree to a point. The Singularity-Adept really can't bank on priming and detonating their own explosions. They  can  self-detonate, but it requires the player to operate within a terrifying and narrow margin of error. As a duder who isn't very good at video games, that's probably not a square deal. \n I love the new Singularity Adept much in the same way I like the Paladin. I'm now a de facto shield stripper. 200+ damage p/second isn't monumental on Gold, but that chip damage plus the overwhelming assault from a Hurricane slotted with Disruptor Ammo helps the Adept soften the front lines up. Shockwave can stagger pretty much everything, and Warp is there to really hurt the armored guys. \n Maybe I'm in the minority on this, but I always found the Human Adept to be dependent on other strong power users.

Or a cube upgrade?\nIf we are talking Charsi imbue, you can only imbue WHITE items. This includes superior, but they will not neccesarily be superior after imbuing (they get random base-modifications). Bloodfist and Gorefoot are both uniques (gold), and therefore not eligible for imbuing.\nWhen you imbue, the item level matters (the item level is hidden). The item is the same level as the monster who dropped it. That means, that the higher level the monster who dropped it, the more stats is available on that item. It is important to note that an item doesn't neccesarily use all it's stat potential. This means that the same item dropped in a1 and a2 can has the possibility of some very different outcomes.\nAfter the imbue, the item can be as good as if the monster itself had dropped a rare (yellow) item. Imbued weapons will always turn out as rare items.\nTo answer your question, you should just progress like you are now, fighting the hardest monsters you can. When a potential good white item appears, try to imbue that. Class specifiq items has a better chance to give +skills to your class. Circlets has the higest bonuses regarding yellow items. And you can get an extra base stat advantage by using exceoptional (nightmare) items, which will drop in a4-5 from time to time. You can check out monster levels, and item qualities (normal, exceptional, elite) on arreat summit ofc. :) \n EDIT (forgot infoz):\nIn cases of imbue-eligible items with base bonuses (maces, wands, staffs and class specifique items, and any other item with +skills etc.) will loose their current bonuses due to the base item reroll. They can get extra skills from the base item AND the rarity class. Say, if you imbue a staff with +1 fireball, it will reroll that base staff. It might turn out with a staff with +1 icebolt and +1 warmth, and then you add the bonuses the rarity would give you, lets say +1 icebolt and +1 fireball. Then your +1 fireball staff will have turned into a +2 icebolt +1 fireball staff. It might as well turn into any other staff allowed by it's item lvl though. \n As far as I recall, weapon damage and defense values are not rerolled. I am not 100% positive on this though.
